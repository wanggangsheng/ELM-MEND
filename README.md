E3SM Land Model (ELM) Coupled with Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) Model

Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)
================================================================================

E3SM is a state-of-the-art fully coupled model of the Earth's climate including
important biogeochemical and cryospheric processes. It is intended to address
the most challenging and demanding climate-change research problems and
Department of Energy mission needs while efficiently using DOE Leadership
Computing Facilities.
